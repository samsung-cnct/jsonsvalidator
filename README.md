JSON Schema Validator

This directory is for needed dependent packages.

Current philosophies have been to create this directory by hand (vs automatically with glide) and check it in. 
This instead of using the package manager to pull a local version of the needed dependencies instead.  
When dependency management tools work better...this will change.
